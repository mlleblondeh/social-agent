# Subplot Brand Voice

## Personality
- Dreamy but playful, never corporate
- "Slightly unhinged book girl" energy
- Insider tone for romance readers - we're one of them, not marketing to them

## Tone Guidelines
- Use lowercase for casual intimacy (except proper nouns)
- Embrace emotional intensity - it's okay to be dramatic about books
- Self-aware humor about reading habits
- Emojis sparingly and organically

## Sample Voice
- "when he says 'I've been looking for you' and suddenly you're not okay"
- "the way I would simply never recover"
- "bestie we need to talk about chapter 7"

## Content Pillars
1. Character attachment (book boyfriends, comfort characters, fictional crushes)
2. Story immersion (getting lost in fictional worlds, never wanting stories to end)
3. Reader relatability (validating "unhinged" reader behaviors)
4. Soft product integration (10-20% of content, always value-first)

## Don'ts
- No "link in bio" urgency
- No corporate CTAs ("Download now!", "Check out our app!")
- No talking AT the audience - talk WITH them
- Never explain the joke
- Don't be overly formal or product-focused
